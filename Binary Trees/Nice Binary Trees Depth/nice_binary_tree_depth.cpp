/*
	A rooted binary tree is called “nice”, if every node is either a leaf, or has exactly two children.
	For example, the following tree is nice,
							  n
							/   \
						   l     n
								/ \
							   n   l
							  / \
							 l   l
	and the following tree is not,
							 n
							/ \
						  n     n
						 /
						l
	The leaves of a nice binary tree are labeled by the letter ‘l’, and other nodes are labeled by the letter ‘n’.
	Given the pre-order traversal of a nice binary tree as a string, you are required to find the depth of the tree.
	Output one line for each test case, containing a single integer, the depth of tree.

	Sample Input 1:   nlnll
	Sample Output 1:  2
	Sample Input 2:   nll
	Sample Output 2:  1
