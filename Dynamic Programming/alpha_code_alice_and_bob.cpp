/*
   Alice and Bob need to send secret messages to each other and are discussing ways to encode their messages:
   Alice: “Let’s just use a very simple code: We’ll assign ‘A’ the code word 1, ‘B’ will be 2, and so on down
   to ‘Z’ being assigned 26.”

   Bob: “That’s a stupid code, Alice. Suppose I send you the word ‘BEAN’ encoded as 25114. You could decode
   that in many different ways!”

   Alice: “Sure you could, but what words would you get? Other than ‘BEAN’, you’d get ‘BEAAD’, ‘YAAD’, ‘YAN’,
   ‘YKD’ and ‘BEKD’. I think you would be able to figure out the correct decoding. And why would you send
   me the word ‘BEAN’ anyway?”

   Bob: “OK, maybe that’s a bad example, but I bet you that if you got a string of length 5000 there would be
   tons of different decodings and with that many you would find at least two different ones that would make sense.”

   Alice: “How many different decodings?”

   Bob: “Jillions!”
   For some reason, Alice is still unconvinced by Bob’s argument, so she requires a program that will determine how
   many decodings there can be for a given string using her code.
   Input
   Input will consist of multiple input sets. Each set will consist of a single line of at most 5000 digits
   representing   a valid encryption (for example, no line will begin with a 0). There will be no spaces
   between the digits. An input   line of ‘0’ will terminate the input and should not be processed.
   Output
   For each input set, output the number of possible decodings for the input string
