> Hash Function -
	>> hash code
	>> compression function

> Collision Handling -
	>> Close Hashing - Every array entry is going to be a linked list.
					   Also called separate chaining.
	>> Open Addressing - If the default initial box is not available to us
					   then we have to find alternate empty box.
					   hi(a) = hf(a) + f(i)
			>>> Linear Probing - Prob linearly one by one. f(i) -> i
			>>> Quadratic Probing - f(i) = i^2
			>>> Double Hashing - f(i) -> i * some other hash func ie h'(a)

			Separate Chaining easier to implement

Modulus Property
	(n1 * n2 * n3) % r
		is equivalent to
	((n1 % r)*(n2 % r)*(n3 % r)) % r
