   Sol:

   We can't move backward in single linked list.
   1st way : Check data at head of linked list with the last node data if its same then
             check data at node after head with the second last node's data. And keep
             repeating the process.

				Time Complexity : O(n^2)

   2nd way : Make a new copy of linked list in a reverse order of the original one. Then
             check each element one by one in both the linked list.

				Time Complexity : O(n) Space Complexity : O(n)

   3rd way : Break the linked list in 2 half and reverse the second part.
             To check palindrome, we just have to reverse latter half of linked list and
             then we can in (n/2) steps total can compare if all elements are same or not.
             For finding mid point, first we can in O(N) traverse whole list and calculate
             total number of elements. Reversing is again O(N).

				  Midpoint - O(n)
                  Reversing - O(n/2) ~ O(n)
                  Time Complexity : O(n) Sapce Complexity O(1)
