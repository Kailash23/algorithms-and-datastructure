/*
   Skip M nodes and Delete n nodes

   Given a linked list and two integers M and N. Traverse the linked list such that you
   retain M nodes then delete next N nodes, continue the same until end of the linked list.
   That is, in the given linked list you need to delete N nodes after every M nodes.
   Input format :

   Line 1 : Linked list elements (separated by space and terminated by -1)
   Line 2 : M
   Line 3 : N

   Sample Input 1 :
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 -1
   2
   2

   Sample Output 1 :
   1 2 5 6

   We are maintaining pointer (ie tail) to the last node of linked list along with head

   which travesing to find second last element in the linked list and then linking it.
