    Virtual functions are those function which are present in base class and
    which are overriden in the derived class.
  */

/*
    Virtual keyword helps compiler to take decision at runtime basically it tells to
    go and check whether v2 is pointing to Car class object or Vehicle class object.

/*
    To achieve runtime polymorphism we need to take help of virtual function.
