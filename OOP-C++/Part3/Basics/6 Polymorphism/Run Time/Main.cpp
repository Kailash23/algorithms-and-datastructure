   Virtual functions are those function which are present in base class and
   which are overriden in the derived class.
 */

/*
   Virtual keyword helps compiler to take decision at runtime basically it tells to
   go and check whether v2 is pointing to Car class object or Vehicle class object.
 */

/*
   To achieve runtime polymorphism we need to take help of virtual function.
